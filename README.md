# Video and Audio Deepfake Detection Project

This project implements a system for detecting deepfake videos and audio using pretrained models. It provides functionalities for video and audio analysis and livestream video processing. It utilizes Streamlit for the web interface, PyAV for video handling, PyTorch for video deepfake detection.

## Features

- **Deepfake Video Detection**: Upload a video to check for deepfake content using a pretrained VideoMAE model.
- **Deepfake Audio Detection**: Upload an audio file to analyze for deepfake content using an audio-based detection model.
- **Livestream Video Analysis**: Perform real-time video analysis for deepfake detection using a webcam.
